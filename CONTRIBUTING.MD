# Contributing

You can build and test the widget by cloning this repository and running:

```term
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the demo.

`npm run dev` compiles all of the JS/HTML/CSS assets into `dist/stormpath.dev.js` and instructs Webpack to watch the `src` directory for changes.

### Running tests

To run the test suite, execute:

```term
$ npm test
$ npm run protractor
```
